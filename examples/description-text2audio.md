# What is text2audio?

Text2audio is a tool that lets your text become voice.  
You write your narration in a file, and the script takes care of the rest.  

First, it reads your words.  
Then, if you want, it translates them into another language.  
It uses one of the latest GPT models, so the translation sounds fluent and natural.  

Next, it shapes the rhythm of the voice.  
You can mark pauses, highlight a phrase, or spell out an acronym.  
That way, the spoken version has the same flow and emphasis you imagined on the page.  

Finally, text2audio passes everything to OpenAI’s speech models.  
They generate clear, realistic voices.  
You choose the style, the format, and the output file.  

In the end, you get a ready-to-use audio track.  
It can be in English, Spanish, or any supported language.  
It can be MP3, WAV, AAC, or Opus.  

That’s the idea: write once, speak anywhere, with text2audio.
