# Demo: Controlling rhythm in text2audio

We can create a natural **pause** by ending a sentence.  
Then starting a new one.  

Ellipses can add a softer, lingering pause… almost like thinking aloud.  

Commas help to insert **short pauses**, and dashes — like this — often produce a break with a change in tone.  

If you want to stress a word, you can isolate it.  
Like this: Important.  

Or use repetition for emphasis.  
Very, very important.  

Finally, short paragraphs give the voice time to breathe.  

And that’s how you guide rhythm and stress with text alone.
